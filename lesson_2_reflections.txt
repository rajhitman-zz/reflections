What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialize a repository it creates a .git file which is a metadata file and will contain the information
of changes made to the repository across various commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a temporary area where we can do the changes before actually comminting them to the git repository.
It prevents unwanted changes from getting commited to the repository. It also helps us decide what files do we want to 
add to a specific commit.
